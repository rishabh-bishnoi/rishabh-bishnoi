### About

I’m a JavaScript developer focused on **structure, clarity, and long-term maintainability**.

Most of my work lives in React and Node.  
I enjoy taking messy requirements and turning them into systems that don’t fight back later.

I’m not interested in clever code.  
I’m interested in code that survives change.

---

### What I do

- Design React component hierarchies that scale  
- Keep state and side-effects predictable  
- Build REST APIs with Node and Express  
- Model MongoDB data with future changes in mind  

A lot of my time goes into refactoring. That’s intentional.

---

### How I think

> If a solution needs a long explanation, it’s probably the wrong one.

- Small components over large ones  
- Explicit logic over abstraction  
- Refactor early, refactor often  
- Optimize for reading, not writing  

---

### Current focus

- Cleaner state management in React  
- Full-stack feature ownership  
- Production-level patterns  
- Writing less code to do more work  

---

### Projects

Pinned repositories reflect how I approach real problems.  
Each project exists to learn one thing properly.
